# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

  Introduction to solving computational problems, including the fundamentals
  of computer programming. Topics include imperative programming constructs
  (variables, loops, conditionals, functions, recursion), basic
  object-oriented constructs (classes, objects), and some fundamental
  algorithms and data structures (dictionaries, arrays, linked lists).
  Student learn these concepts through studying the Python programming
  language.  

## <a name="outcomes">Course Outcomes</a>

Upon completing this course, our goal is for you to be able to:

* Build computer programs to:
  * Effectively solve realistic problems.
  * Organize, analyze, and summarize realistic data sets.
* Read, understand, and explain a computer program.
* Understand and explain computation through:
  * Thinking logically and precisely.
  * Making and testing hypotheses.
* Use modular components to decompose problems and assemble solutions.
* Create abstract, generalized models from specific, complex examples.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment
that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no
partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal
circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and
exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
